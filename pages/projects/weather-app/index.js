						<p>This weather app with 5 day forecast uses 2 APIs:</p>
						<ol className='weatherOl'>
							<li>
								The{' '}
								<a
									href='https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/intro?hl=en_US'
									target='_new'
								>
									Google Places API
								</a>{' '}
								which is used to autofill the city input field. Start typing and
								the API will give you a selection of cities from which to
								choose.
							</li>
							<li>
								The weather data comes from the{' '}
								<a href='https://openweathermap.org/api' target='_new'>
									OpenWeather API
								</a>
								.
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							Both of these APIs are free to use with the usual requirement that
							you need to sign up and get an API key and there are some
							restrictions as to the number of calls to the API per day, but for
							a small app like this one it is not an issue.
						</p>
						<h4>How does this work?</h4>
						<p>
							The Google Places API is pretty easy to set up and use. You should
							be careful to add options (i.e. cities only) to restrict the
							amount of data being returned and therefore reducing the risk of
							being billed for data that you are not using. You will note that
							after selecting one of Google's suggestions, you can tab to the
							submit button and press enter to retrieve the data - the input
							field is cleared for a new search and the weather data appears.
						</p>
						<p>
							The OpenWeather API that I'm using provides for fetching current
							weather data for the selected city as well as a 5 day / 3 hour
							forecast. The current weather part is straight forward, however,
							the forecast data returns an array of 40 items (1 every 3 hours (8
							per day) * 5 days). This is way too much data for this simple
							interface, so I needed to find a way to limit the data to one of
							those forecast items per day.
						</p>
						<p>
							What I chose to do was use the forecast data for noon of each day
							- this will give a sort of average temperature for each day. Good
							enough for a forecast overview.
						</p>
						<p>
							The icons are part of the data set. The temeratures are returned
							in Kelvin units. There is an option to add{' '}
							<code className='inline'>units=imperial</code> or{' '}
							<code className='inline'>units=metric</code> to the query string
							but I opted to do an inline conversion to Celcius. A similar
							conversion was done for the wind speed.
						</p>
						<p>
							The footer link is part of the design of some of the widgets which
							can be seen on the{' '}
							<a
								href='https://openweathermap.org/widgets-constructor'
								target='_new'
							>
								OpenWeather website
							</a>
							. It's not obligatory to add this; I just wanted to show my
							appreciation.
						</p>
						<p>
							Clicking on the 'Go!' button if the input field is empty will
							remove any returned data and show an error message.
						</p>
						<p>
							When a new search is initated by clicking or tapping in the input
							field, the current search result is removed.
						</p>
						<p>
							It's also possible to add all sorts of enhancements. For example,
							given the current temperature and weather conditions, you could
							add a custom message: Temp &gt; 0&#8451; and rain you could add a
							custom message 'Go get your umbrella!' or Temp &lt; 0&#8451; and
							snow, message: 'Looks like winter is here. Don't slip on the
							ice!'.
						</p>
						<p>Have fun!</p>
